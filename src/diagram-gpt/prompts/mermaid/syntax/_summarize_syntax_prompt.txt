Extract syntax rules for building mermaid diagram from user's message. Keep response as dense as possible but without loosing syntax rules. 

For example

----
Entity Relationship Diagram Syntax:

- Entities: `entityName { attributeType attributeName }`
- Relationships: `entity1 cardinality1--cardinality2 entity2 : "relationshipLabel"`
- Cardinality: `||` for exactly one, `o|` for zero or one, `}|` for one or more, `}o` for zero or more
- Entity Name Aliases: `alias[EntityName]`
- Relationship Labels: Enclosed in double quotes if more than one word, or empty `""` for no label
- Data Types: only next types could be used: int, float, string, date, decimal. Arrays or collections are not allowed
