To use Azure-PlantUML it is necessary to use specific `!includes`.
First, AzurePuml url should be defined and `AzureCommon.puml` should be included.
Then .puml files should be included for each service defined under category in json object below.
For example, if following categories and services are defined

```
{{
    "AIMachineLearning": ["AzureBotService", "AzureBatchAI"],
    "Intune" : ["AzureIntune"]
}}
```

Following code should be included after @startuml in PlantUML diagram code:

```
!define AzurePuml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/Azure-PlantUML/release/2-2/dist
!includeurl AzurePuml/AzureCommon.puml
!includeurl AzurePuml/AIMachineLearning/AzureBotService.puml
!includeurl AzurePuml/AIMachineLearning/AzureBatchAI.puml
!includeurl AzurePuml/Intune/AzureIntune.puml
```

Azure services to include:
{services_by_category}

Azure services syntax rules:
{services_syntax_rules}
