To use AWS PlantUML it is necessary to use specific `!includes`.
First, AWSPuml url should be defined and `AWSCommon.puml` should be included.
Then .puml files should be included for each service defined under category in json object below.
For example, if following categories and services are defined

```
{{
    "Robotics": ["RoboMaker"],
    "MachineLearning" : ["SageMakerModel"]
}}
```

Following code should be included after @startuml in PlantUML diagram code:

```
!define AWSPuml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-icons-for-plantuml/v17.0/dist
!includeurl AWSPuml/AWSCommon.puml
!includeurl AWSPuml/Robotics/RoboMaker.puml
!includeurl AWSPuml/MachineLearning/SageMakerModel.puml
```

AWS services to include:
{services_by_category}
