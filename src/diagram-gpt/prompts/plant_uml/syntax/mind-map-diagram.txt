MindMap Diagram Syntax:

- MindMaps in PlantUML are created using `@startmindmap` and `@endmindmap`.
- Nodes are defined with `*` for root node and `**` for sub-nodes. More `*` means deeper level.
- Nodes can be placed on left side by adding `left side` before defining them.
- Multiline nodes can be created with `:` and `;`.
- Multiple root nodes can be created by defining multiple `*` nodes.
- Node colors can be changed with `[#Color]` inline or by defining a style with `BackgroundColor`.
- Node box can be removed with `_` after `*`.
- Diagram direction can be changed with `left side`.
- Node style can be changed with `<style>` block. Styles can be applied to `node`, `:depth(n)`, and `boxless`.
- Word wrap can be controlled with `MaximumWidth` setting.
- Creole or HTML Creole can be used on MindMap with `:==Creole` or `: <b>HTML Creole`.
